*<b>This website is a draft.</b>*

Welcome to the [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/) ##math channel's home page!
We are an IRC community interested in mathematics on all levels.

### Connecting
The ##math channel can be found on [irc.libera.chat:6697](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697) (TLS).
Or join directly in the [web client](https://web.libera.chat/##math).
Further information on connecting to Libera Chat can be found [here](https://libera.chat/guides/connect).

### Guidelines
* Just ask your question! Please ask a complete question,
  using a pastebin like [MathB.in](http://mathb.in/) if the question is longer than a couple of lines.
  Links to screenshots of problems are common as well.
  This way people can better decide whether they can help you.
* Be patient. Many users are doing other things and only check for interesting topics on IRC on occasion.
* Limit off-topic chatter to a minimum.
  There's a ##math-offtopic channel for lengthy discussions about topics other than math.
* Alert a channel operator in case of trouble.
  The ##math-ops channel is a good place for that.
