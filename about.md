Welcome to the [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/) ##math channel's home page!
We are an IRC community interested in mathematics on all levels.

### Connecting
The ##math channel can be found on [irc.libera.chat:6697](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697) (TLS).
Further information on connecting to Libera Chat can be found [here](https://libera.chat/guides/connect).

### Guidelines
* Just ask your question! Try to ask complete questions, using a pastebin like [MathB.in](http://mathb.in/) if the question is long. This allows people to better decide whether they can help you.
* Be patient. Many people are doing other things and only check for interesting topics on IRC on occasion.
* Limit off-topic chatter to a minimum. There's a ##math-offtopic channel for lengthy discussions about topics other than math.
* Alert a channel operator in case of trouble. ##math-ops is a good place for that.
